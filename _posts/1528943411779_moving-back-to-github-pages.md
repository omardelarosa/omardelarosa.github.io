A while back, [I made a big deal about moving this site to Cloudflare and using HTTPS](https://www.omardelarosa.com/posts/static-hosting-saga-2.html).  Well now that [Github Pages supports HTTPS for custom domains](https://blog.github.com/2018-05-01-github-pages-custom-domains-https/) it's time I moved back (Ultimately, Ilove the convenience of GH Pages.)

This will obviously have no functional difference on this page.  But in case you were wondering, it's back on GH Pages and the code/content for [this site lives entirely in a static repo](https://github.com/omardelarosa/omardelarosa.github.io).
